# medical-papers-skimmers

Also Known as SkimLit or PubMed.

In this notebook, I replicated a [state-of-the-art (NLP) model](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.06071) to breakdown research abstracts into smaller, more understandable pieces to help researchers skim through literatures.

**Model Score on validataion data:**
* **Accuracy** on previously unseen data of **%86.27**
* **precision** on previously unseen data of **0.863**
* **recall** on previously unseen data of **0.863**
* **F1** on previously unseen data of **0.860**
